## About me

My goal is to start a career Junior React developer and develop in this area. I'm currently working as HTML/CSS developer. I took the first step towards my goal a year ago — I started studying the online course React-developer at HTML Academy. For a year I studied HTML & CSS, advanced JavaScript, Gulp and Webpack, design patterns, object-oriented programming, React, and Redux. Now I want to strengthen that knowledge and add some projects to my portfolio.

## Skills

- HTML, CSS/SCSS, JavaScript
- React, Redux
- Git
- Gulp, Webpack
- Figma/Photoshop
- Semantic, cross-browser, responsive layout

## Code example
```
String.prototype.toJadenCase = function (str) {
  return this.split(' ').map(word => word.replace(/^./, word[0].toUpperCase())).join(' ');
};
```
